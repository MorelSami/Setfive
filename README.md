# Setfive
Dad's Jokes Project

Dad's Jokes is a personal project that i am working on to improve development using CodeIgniter MVC (PHP) Framework. 
This simple project consists taking in jokes from a remote host API (https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api, specificaly the "Search for Jokes
API" with any joke containing the term "hey"), storing them in a database, and then allowing  signed up users to search for a joke as well as rate and comment on any joke. 

Project Info: Setfive Version:1.0.0 (This is still the first version so far)

Installation and Development Languages:

PHP 5.6 >
CodeIgniter(PHP MVC Framework) //Please you can read the codeigniter.rst on how it works

How to run Project SetFive:

Once everything is setup and ready go, all you have to do is clone or copy the project flles into your localhost server web repository.
I included an sql file(Jokes_db.sql) which you can manually run on your MYSQL server once installed.
It should immediately create all required tables for this project into your defined database. 

Once your database is all setup, you run the localhost web server and go to "http://localhost/Setfive/" which is the home/login page for any user.

SetFive Project Specifications (Version 1.0.0)
-Initially my Jokes_db.sql file when run should create a general user for you to log in. (Note: you can obviously modify the user credentials in the user table 
 before manually running the sql file) 
-The user can also create a new account in order to login.
